This experiment is used to determine the surface tension of a given liquid.

Q.  TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE DENSITY OF A GIVEN LIQUID WHAT WILL YOU DO?
ANS:  first we will determine the weight of specific gravity bottle. Then we will put the given liquid in that bottle and measure the weight of the bottle with the liquid sample. now we will clean the bottle and let it rinse with ethyl alcohol then dry it by drier. After then we will pour the distilled water in it and measure the weight of bottle with the water. then we can calculate the relative density of that liquid by this formula.

      weight of liquid in specific gravity bottle - weight of specific gravity bottle
 p =  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      weight of distilled water in specific gravity bottle - weight of specific gravity bottle.


Q2. WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY SURFACE TENSION WRITE ITS UNIT.
Ans: the force exerted by the liquid surface to not collapes or breakdown is known as surface tension. 
ANS: The property of liquid by which a shrinks to its minimum surface area. which is spherical in shape.
    its unit in cgs is dyne/cm. 

Q3. WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF STALAGMOMETER?

ANS - after releasing the one side of the tube droping of the liquid particle occurs through the capilary and countdown of drop start then observe it . 

ANS: rather than sucking the stalagmometer better to suck my dick bitch. (if i were the examiner i will tell to the girls.)



Q4. WHAT IS THE FORMULA OF SURFACE TENSION?

ratio of surface tension = ratio of density : ratio of number of drops
